# KatanaShowdown
My first official indie game made using Unreal Engine. It's an action game involving the use of a katana to fight enemies.

In this game, you'll need to survive waves of enemies that will face you. You are armed with a katana and you'll have to unleash samurai skills to fight your way. As the game progresses, the number of enemies will increase but there will be more difficult enemies to face.
